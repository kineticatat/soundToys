blocking vs accepting body gestures

---------------------------

Metaphor of sound as an object - but its not an object, and it is gone by the time I act

Are haptics helpful - scooping vs not
Aligning metaphors of output vs input when dealing with abstract media such as sound

Most efforts go out - wring only one that doesnâ€™t? shaping of core - carving
Microphones are bad mechanical ears - about the absorption of the world, not about the impact on the world

Sticky hand - flicking sound out and sticking in a location - speakers
Sticky hand - reaching long to grab and bring back - also specific area instead of broad

Out vs. in is a big concept

In order for the system to express to me, I have to know what I can accept (and how)

What is an accepting interaction vs. an expressing interaction

Reaching at end of the kinesphere - pushing/ flicking is easier than grabbing with fingertips

Localized vs. ambient sound
Listening posture - going internal, dropping head, closing eyes
Getting people to listen is to talk softly - not yelling

Identifying why we have issues with languaging in this project - metaphors, etc. why flick not working as a metaphor for recording - because its the wrong directionality

Tangibility vs. ephemerality of sound 0 tend to think of control and manipulation = rather than bringing in perception

Is sound soft/ hard? Flexible/ rigid?  Hard objects record hard sounds, soft objects soft sounds
