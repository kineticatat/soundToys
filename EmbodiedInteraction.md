Design considerations paper

What do we mean when we say "embodied"? why is this perspective important as the value to the moco community? (does this go to Shusterman/ 3rd wave HCI?)

Are we just playing with different applications of shaping on interaction design? giving a series of examples? collection/ device focused gestures?

blocking vs accepting body gestures

Push/ Pull
Spoke/ Gather
Importance of directionality in metaphors for embodied interaction 

About the metaphor itself or how it is mapped to the interface
What is existing in metaphors, but what is important is how it is applied in systems

Is there directionality implied in the metaphor that is not included in the design?

thoughts on Metaphores in interaction
Often when we are interacting with devices we approach the tack as reaching out to a device to do something for us. When we consider an embodied approach

Part of this argument is (might be) in the differene between  embodied and device driven metqphores. When focusing on designing a device it is seen as a tool and therefore our interactions are out to controling the tool. 
IT IS WHEN we are considering the embodied experience that the idea of  an acepting/ bringing in gesture becomes of interest. 

for example if i design a device to socke up sound i reach out to start it's process for socking up the sound. however, if i am designing a device that alows me to soak up a sound the gesture needs to be me bringing the sound into me through the device.


even in this , when designing a device the actions of the device still needs (in its design) need a inwards intention

Metaphor of sound as an object - but its not an object, and it is gone by the time I act

Are haptics helpful - scooping vs not
Aligning metaphors of output vs input when dealing with abstract media such as sound

Most efforts go out - wring only one that doesnâ€™t? shaping of core - carving
Microphones are bad mechanical ears - about the absorption of the world, not about the impact on the world

Sticky hand - flicking sound out and sticking in a location - speakers
Sticky hand - reaching long to grab and bring back - also specific area instead of broad

Out vs. in is a big concept

In order for the system to express to me, I have to know what I can accept (and how)

What is an accepting interaction vs. an expressing interaction

Reaching at end of the kinesphere - pushing/ flicking is easier than grabbing with fingertips

Localized vs. ambient sound
Listening posture - going internal, dropping head, closing eyes
Getting people to listen is to talk softly - not yelling

Identifying why we have issues with languaging in this project - metaphors, etc. why flick not working as a metaphor for recording - because its the wrong directionality

Tangibility vs. ephemerality of sound 0 tend to think of control and manipulation = rather than bringing in perception

Is sound soft/ hard? Flexible/ rigid?  Hard objects record hard sounds, soft objects soft sounds
